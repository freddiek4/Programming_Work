He whimpers pitifully \\r\\n          and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches \\r\\n          through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, \\r\\n          entering school.\\r\\n          BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the \\r\\n          mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but \\r\\n          still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.  \\r\\n                    Did you change your hair?\\r\\n                    No.\\r\\n                    You might wanna think about it\\r\\n          Leave the girls\\' room and enter the hallway.\\r\\n          Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both \\r\\n          boys\\r\\n          and girls alike.\\r\\n                           (adoring)\\r\\n                    Hey, Bianca.\\r\\n                    Awesome shoes.\\r\\n          The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and \\r\\n          unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, \\r\\n          acknowledging her fans.\\r\\n          CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, \\r\\n          farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery \\r\\n          guidance counselor.\\r\\n                    I\\'m sure you won\\'t find Padua any \\r\\n                    different than your old school.

His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he \\r\\n          is.\\r\\n          Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    Patrick Verona.  I see we\\'re making our \\r\\n                    visits a weekly ritual.\\r\\n          She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming \\r\\n          smile.\\r\\n                    I missed you.\\r\\n                    It says here you exposed yourself to a \\r\\n                    group of freshmen girls.\\r\\n                    It was a bratwurst.  I was eating \\r\\n                    lunch.\\r\\n                    With the teeth of your zipper?\\r\\n          She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron \\r\\n          shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, \\r\\n          brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game \\r\\n          show host.\\r\\n                    You the new guy?\\r\\n                    So they tell me...\\r\\n                    C\\'mon.  I\\'m supposed to give you the \\r\\n                    tour.\\r\\n          They head out of the office\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    So -- which Dakota you from?\\r\\n                    North, actually.  How\\'d you   ?\\r\\n                    I was kidding. People actually live \\r\\n                    there?\\r\\n                    Yeah.  A couple.  We\\'re outnumbered by \\r\\n                    the cows, though.\\r\\n                    How many people were in your old \\r\\n                    school?\\r\\n                    Thirty-two.\\r\\n                    Get out!\\r\\n                    How many people go here?\\r\\n                    Couple thousand. Most of them evil\\r\\n          Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through \\r\\n          the crowd as he points to various cliques.\\r\\n                    We\\'ve got your basic beautiful people. \\r\\n                    Unless they talk to you first, don\\'t \\r\\n                    bother.\\r\\n          The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader \\r\\n          splendor.\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    Those \\'re your cowboys.\\r\\n          Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle.

They just jack off to Clint \\r\\n                    Eastwood.\\r\\n          They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled \\r\\n          around it.\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    To the right, we have the Coffee Kids.  \\r\\n                    Very edgy.  Don\\'t make any sudden \\r\\n                    movements around them.\\r\\n          Michael continues the tour\\r\\n                    And these delusionals are the White \\r\\n                    Rastae.\\r\\n          Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets \\r\\n          lounge on the grass.

Think they\\'re black.  \\r\\n                    Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a \\r\\n                    lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I \\r\\n                    mean.\\r\\n          Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?\\r\\n                           (very stoned)\\r\\n                    Michael, my brother, peace\\r\\n          Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the \\r\\n          cafeteria.\\r\\n                    So where do you fit in all this?\\r\\n          Loud music and loud students.

Sophomore. Don\\'t \\r\\n                    even think about it\\r\\n                    Why not?\\r\\n                    I could start with your haircut, but it \\r\\n                    doesn\\'t matter.  She\\'s not allowed to \\r\\n                    date until her older sister does.  And \\r\\n                    that\\'s an impossibility.\\r\\n          A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space \\r\\n          MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English \\r\\n          Teacher, tries to remember what she\\'s talking about.\\r\\n                    Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that \\r\\n                    does it for our analysis of The Old Man \\r\\n                    and the Sea.  Any other comments?\\r\\n                           (with dread)\\r\\n                    Kat?\\r\\n          Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes \\r\\n          off her glasses and speaks up.\\r\\n                    Why didn\\'t we just read the Hardy Boys?\\r\\n                    I\\'m sorry?\\r\\n                    This book is about a guy and his \\r\\n                    fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial \\r\\n                    topic.\\r\\n          The other students roll their eyes.\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    Frankly, I\\'m baffled as to why we still \\r\\n                    revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, \\r\\n                    alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of \\r\\n                    cats.\\r\\n          JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, \\r\\n          makes fun of her from his row.\\r\\n                    As opposed to a bitter self-righteous \\r\\n                    hag who has no friends?\\r\\n          A few giggles.  Kat ignores him.  A practiced gesture\\r\\n                    That\\'s enough, Mr. Dorsey.\\r\\n          Really gets fired up now\\r\\n                    I guess the school board thinks because \\r\\n                    Hemingway\\'s male and an asshole, he\\'s \\r\\n                    worthy of our time\\r\\n          She looks up at Ms. Blaise, who is now fighting with her \\r\\n          pill box.\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    What about Colette?

That\\'s so cute.  \\r\\n                    What\\'s your name again?\\r\\n                           (embarrassed)\\r\\n                    Forget it.\\r\\n          Bianca seizes an opportunity.\\r\\n                    No, no, it\\'s my fault -- we didn\\'t have \\r\\n                    a proper introduction ---\\r\\n                    Cameron.\\r\\n                    The thing is, Cameron -- I\\'m at the \\r\\n                    mercy of a particularly hideous breed of \\r\\n                    loser.  My sister.  I can\\'t date until \\r\\n                    she does.\\r\\n                    Seems like she could get a date easy \\r\\n                    enough...\\r\\n          She fingers a lock of her hair.  He looks on, dazzled.\\r\\n          The problem is, she\\'s completely anti-social.\\r\\n                    Why?\\r\\n                    Unsolved mystery.  She used to be \\r\\n                    really popular when she started high \\r\\n                    school, then it was just like she got \\r\\n                    sick of it or something.\\r\\n                    That\\'s a shame.\\r\\n          She reaches out and touches his arm\\r\\n                    Gosh, if only we could find Kat a \\r\\n                    boyfriend...\\r\\n                    Let me see what I can do.\\r\\n          Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is\\r\\n          A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks.  \\r\\n          Michael and Cameron go for the spleen.\\r\\n                    You\\'re in school for one day and you \\r\\n                    ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you \\r\\n                    have no concept of the high school \\r\\n                    social code?\\r\\n          Cameron grins away\\r\\n                    I teach her French, get to know her, \\r\\n                    dazzle her with charm and she falls in \\r\\n                    love with me.\\r\\n                    Unlikely, but even so, she still can\\'t \\r\\n                    go out with you.  So what\\'s the\\r\\n                    point?\\r\\n          Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab \\r\\n          tables away.  He\\'s wearing biker glasses instead of goggles \\r\\n          as he tries to revive his frog.\\r\\n                    What about him?\\r\\n                           (confused)\\r\\n                    You wanna go out with him?\\r\\n          The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows\\r\\n                           (impatient)\\r\\n                    No - he could wrangle with the sister.\\r\\n          Michael smiles.  Liking the intrigue.\\r\\n                    What makes you think he\\'ll do it?\\r\\n                    He seems like he thrives on danger\\r\\n                    No kidding.  He\\'s a criminal.  I heard \\r\\n                    he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just \\r\\n                    got out of Alcatraz...\\r\\n                    They always let felons sit in on Honors \\r\\n                    Biology?\\r\\n                    I\\'m serious, man, he\\'s whacked.  He \\r\\n                    sold his own liver on the black market \\r\\n                    so he could buy new speakers.\\r\\n                    Forget his reputation.  Do you think \\r\\n                    we\\'ve got a plan or not?\\r\\n                    Did she actually say she\\'d go out with \\r\\n                    you?\\r\\n                    That\\'s what I just said\\r\\n          Michael processes this.\\r\\n                    You know, if you do go out with Bianca, \\r\\n                    you\\'d be set.  You\\'d outrank everyone.  \\r\\n                    Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.\\r\\n                    I thought you hated those people.\\r\\n                    Hey -- I\\'ve gotta have a few clients \\r\\n                    when I get to Wall Street.\\r\\n          A cowboy flicks the frog\\'s heart into one of the Coffee \\r\\n          Kid\\'s latte.  Cameron presses on, over the melee.\\r\\n                    So now all we gotta do is talk to him.\\r\\n          He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another \\r\\n          frog, with full-on sound effects.\\r\\n                    I\\'ll let you handle that.\\r\\n          Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood\\r\\n          Michael sits next to PEPE, a Coffee Kid, who holds out his \\r\\n          jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway.  Inside \\r\\n          several bags of coffee hang from hooks.\\r\\n                    Some people like the Colombian, but it \\r\\n                    all depends on your acidity preference.  \\r\\n                    Me?  I prefer East African and \\r\\n                    Indonesian.  You start the day with a \\r\\n                    Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian \\r\\n                    Sidamo in your cup, you\\'re that much \\r\\n                    farther ahead than someone drinkin\\' \\r\\n                    Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I \\r\\n                    mean?\\r\\n          Michael nods solemnly.\\r\\n          Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that \\r\\n          looks like a machete out of a two-by-four.\\r\\n          Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer\\r\\n                    Hey, there\\r\\n          In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his \\r\\n          direction.\\r\\n          Cameron slinks away.\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    Later, then. \\r\\n          Michael watches, shaking his head.\\r\\n          Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria \\r\\n          tray with a magic marker.\\r\\n          Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be\\r\\n                    Hey.\\r\\n                    Are you lost?\\r\\n                    Nope - just came by to chat\\r\\n                    We don\\'t chat.\\r\\n                    Well, actually, I thought I\\'d run an \\r\\n                    idea by you.  You know, just to see if \\r\\n                    you\\'re interested.\\r\\n                    We\\'re not.\\r\\n          He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to \\r\\n          draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker.   Michael \\r\\n          suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.\\r\\n                           (grimacing)\\r\\n                    Hear me out.  You want Bianca don\\'t \\r\\n                    you?\\r\\n          Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    But she can\\'t go out with you because \\r\\n                    her sister is this insane head case and \\r\\n                    no one will go out with her. right?\\r\\n                    Does this conversation have a purpose?\\r\\n                    So what you need to do is recruit a guy \\r\\n                    who\\'ll go out with her.  Someone who\\'s \\r\\n                    up for the job.\\r\\n          Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his \\r\\n          turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage \\r\\n          can, rather than in it.\\r\\n          That guy?  I heard he ate a live duck once.  Everything but \\r\\n          the beak and the feet.\\r\\n                    Exactly\\r\\n          Joey turns to look at Michael.\\r\\n          What\\'s in it for you?\\r\\n                    Oh, hey, nothin\\' man   Purely good will \\r\\n                    on my part.\\r\\n          He rises to leave and turns to the others.\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    I have a dick on my face, don\\'t I? \\r\\n          Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey\\'s artwork \\r\\n          off his face as Cameron watches.\\r\\n                    You got him involved?\\r\\n                    Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when \\r\\n                    you let the enemy think he\\'s \\r\\n                    orchestrating the battle, you\\'re in a \\r\\n                    position of power. We let him pretend \\r\\n                    he\\'s calling the shots, and while he\\'s \\r\\n                    busy setting up the plan, you have time \\r\\n                    to woo Bianca.\\r\\n          Cameron grins and puts an arm around him\\r\\n                    You\\'re one brilliant guy\\r\\n          Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in.\\r\\n          Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but \\r\\n          it\\'s not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who \\r\\n          Embraces Guys In The Bathroom. \\r\\n          Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a \\r\\n          manly way for the others, now watching.\\r\\n          Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai.  Mandella is \\r\\n          smoking.\\r\\n                    So he has this huge raging fit about \\r\\n                    Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to \\r\\n                    his male-dominated, puking frat boy, \\r\\n                    number one golf team school. I have no \\r\\n                    say at all.\\r\\n                    William would never have gone to a \\r\\n                    state school.\\r\\n                    William didn\\'t even go to high school\\r\\n                    That\\'s never been proven\\r\\n                    Neither has his heterosexuality.\\r\\n          Mandella replies with a look of ice.  Kat uses the moment to \\r\\n          stub out Mandella\\'s cigarette. \\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    I appreciate your efforts toward a \\r\\n                    speedy death, but I\\'m consuming.\\r\\n                           (pointing at her \\r\\n                           food)\\r\\n                    Do you mind?\\r\\n                    Does it matter?\\r\\n                    If I was Bianca, it would be, \"Any \\r\\n                    school you want, precious.

Very doubtful.\\r\\n          She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone.\\r\\n                           (calling after her)\\r\\n                    You\\'re no bargain either, sweetheart.\\r\\n          Scurvy appears at his side\\r\\n                    So I guess the Jeep won\\'t be getting a \\r\\n                    new Blaupunkt.\\r\\n          ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch.\\r\\n                    He took the bait.\\r\\n          Kat washes her face at the sink.  Bianca appears behind her, \\r\\n          and attempts to twist Kat\\'s hair into a chignon.\\r\\n          She wacks Bianca away.\\r\\n                    Have you ever considered a new look?

She \\r\\n          finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug.\\r\\n          She looks up and finds Patrick sitting on the hood of her \\r\\n          car\\r\\n                    Nice ride.

Joey walks up and grabs her \\r\\n          around the waist.\\r\\n          She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just \\r\\n          as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and \\r\\n          straw -- in his hand.\\r\\n          Chastity glares with a jealous fury after Bianca and Joey, \\r\\n          then gives Cameron the once-over and walks away.\\r\\n          Michael appears.\\r\\n                    Extremely unfortunate maneuver.\\r\\n                    The hell is that?  What kind of \\'guy \\r\\n                    just picks up a girl and carries her \\r\\n                    away while you\\'re talking to her?\\r\\n                    Buttholus extremus.

She wants to go out with \\r\\n                    Dorsey.  Not me.  I\\'m an idiot!\\r\\n          Michael pats him on the shoulder.\\r\\n                    At least you\\'re self-aware\\r\\n          Kat and a crowd of White Rastas and Cowboys stand in a \\r\\n          drunken group hug singing \"I Shot the Sheriff\".  Kat has \\r\\n          another shot glass in hand.\\r\\n          Patrick is showing a scar to an inebriated, enraptured \\r\\n          cheerleader.  He looks up at Kat and smiles meets his eyes \\r\\n          then looks away.\\r\\n          Bianca stands next to Joey, sipping from her beer\\r\\n                    So yeah, I\\'ve got the Sears catalog \\r\\n                    thing going -- and the tube sock gig \" \\r\\n                    that\\'s gonna be huge.  And then I\\'m up \\r\\n                    for an ad for Queen Harry next week.\\r\\n                    Queen Harry?\\r\\n                    It\\'s a gay cruise line, but I\\'ll be, \\r\\n                    like, wearing a uniform and stuff.\\r\\n          Bianca tries to appear impressed, but it\\'s getting \\r\\n          difficult.\\r\\n                    Neat...\\r\\n                    My agent says I\\'ve got a good shot at \\r\\n                    being the Prada guy next year.\\r\\n          He looks over her shoulder and waves at someone.  Bianca \\r\\n          takes the opportunity to escape.\\r\\n                    I\\'ll be right back.\\r\\n          Bianca shuts the door and leans on it with a sigh.  Chastity \\r\\n          applies lip-gloss in the mirror.\\r\\n                    He practically proposed when he found \\r\\n                    out we had the same dermatologist. I \\r\\n                    mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, \\r\\n                    but he\\'s not exactly relevant party \\r\\n                    conversation.\\r\\n                    Is he oily or dry?\\r\\n                    Combination.  I don\\'t know -- I thought \\r\\n                    he\\'d be different.  More of a \\r\\n                    gentleman...\\r\\n          Chastity rolls her eyes\\r\\n                    Bianca, I don\\'t think the highlights of \\r\\n                    dating Joey Dorsey are going to include \\r\\n                    door-opening and coat-holding.\\r\\n                    Sometimes I wonder if the guys we\\'re \\r\\n                    supposed to want to go out with are the \\r\\n                    ones we actually want to go out with, \\r\\n                    you know?\\r\\n                    All I know is -- I\\'d give up my private \\r\\n                    line to go out with a guy like Joey.\\r\\n          There\\'s a KNOCK at the door.  Bianca opens it to find a very \\r\\n          drunken Kat.\\r\\n                    Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need \\r\\n                    to tell you --\\r\\n                           (cutting her off)\\r\\n                    I really don\\'t think I need any social \\r\\n                    advice from you right now.\\r\\n          Bianca grabs Chastity\\'s arm and they exit\\r\\n          Patrick tries to remove a shot glass from Kat\\'s hand.\\r\\n          Maybe you should let me have it.\\r\\n          Kat is fierce in her refusal to let go\\r\\n                    I want another one\\r\\n          Joey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting \\r\\n          him from his task.\\r\\n                    My man\\r\\n          As Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of \\r\\n          dancing people in the dining room.\\r\\n                           (annoyed)\\r\\n                    It\\'s about time.\\r\\n                    A deal\\'s a deal.\\r\\n          He peels off some bills\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    How\\'d you do it?\\r\\n                    Do what?\\r\\n                    Get her to act like a human\\r\\n          A very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and \\r\\n          starts dancing by herself.  She lets loose, hair flying. \\r\\n          She\\'s almost burlesque.\\r\\n          Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on\\r\\n          She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot \\r\\n          hanging from the rack above the center island.  She starts \\r\\n          to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her.\\r\\n          The others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale. \\r\\n          Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up\\r\\n                    Okay?\\r\\n                    I\\'m fine.

My dog \\r\\n                    went to sleep with a concussion and woke \\r\\n                    up a vegetable. Not that I could tell \\r\\n                    the difference...\\r\\n          She tries to sit on the floor\\r\\n                    Okay, I\\'ll just sleep but stay awake, \\r\\n                    okay?\\r\\n          He pulls her back to her\\r\\n                    C\\'mon, let\\'s walk\\r\\n          As Patrick walks Kat through the dining room, Cameron  grabs \\r\\n          his arm.\\r\\n          CAMERON We need to talk.\\r\\n                    Cameron, I\\'m a little busy\\r\\n                    It\\'s off.

Being sung by Patrick.\\r\\n                    \"This morning, I woke up with this \\r\\n                    feeling, I didn\\'t know how to deal with, \\r\\n                    and so I just decided to myself--\"\\r\\n          The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands \\r\\n          beneath the window, crooning.\\r\\n          Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and \\r\\n          doing backup vocal s.\\r\\n                    \"I\\'d hide it to myself.

She gives him a smile and he perks \\r\\n          up a little.\\r\\n          Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He \\r\\n          turns fully to face her.\\r\\n                    Sir, I\\'d like to state for the record \\r\\n                    that Mr. Verona \\' s current \\r\\n                    incarceration is unnecessary.  I never \\r\\n                    filed a complaint.\\r\\n                    You didn\\'t have to.  He disrupted a \\r\\n                    classroom.\\r\\n          Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the \\r\\n          window.\\r\\n          Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she \\' s talking about.\\r\\n          She motions again, and looks toward the window with an \\r\\n          expression that says, \"Make a break for it, moron.\"\\r\\n          Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick \\r\\n          inches out of his seat toward the window.\\r\\n          The other miscreants watch with glee.\\r\\n                    But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a \\r\\n                    simple serenade warrants a week of \\r\\n                    detention.  There are far more hideous \\r\\n                    acts than off-key singing being \\r\\n                    performed by the student body on a \\r\\n                    regular basis.\\r\\n          Patrick is halfway out the window now.  And none too happy \\r\\n          about it, considering they\\'re on the second floor.\\r\\n          He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN.  He \\r\\n          starts to turn away from Kat\\r\\n                    You\\'re not gonna change my mind, Kat. \\r\\n                    Rules stick.\\r\\n          Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for \\r\\n          the tree.\\r\\n                    Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There\\'s something \\r\\n                    I\\'ve always wanted to show you.\\r\\n          He turns back toward her again, the very second before he \\r\\n          would have spotted Patrick.\\r\\n          Kat glances toward the window.  Patrick\\'s just about to make \\r\\n          the jump.\\r\\n                    What?\\r\\n                    These.\\r\\n          From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra \\r\\n          at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.\\r\\n          The miscreants cheer, for both the daring\\' escape and the \\r\\n          flash of skin.\\r\\n          Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern.\\r\\n                    I\\'m going to let that slide, Katarina.  \\r\\n                    But if I catch you doing that again, \\r\\n                    you\\'ll be in here with the rest of these \\r\\n                    guys.\\r\\n          He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without \\r\\n          noticing Patrick\\'s absence.\\r\\n          Kat smiles at him.\\r\\n                    Thank you, Mr. Chapin.\\r\\n          Kat bolts out the door.  Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle \\r\\n          mag, wiping the sweat from his brow.\\r\\n          Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing \\r\\n          no one.\\r\\n                    He left!

When she gets to his level, she \\r\\n          perches on the branch next to him.  He grins at her.\\r\\n          Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a \\r\\n          monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she\\'s been \\r\\n          duped.\\r\\n                    You shit!\\r\\n          She climbs down after him\\r\\n          Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games\\r\\n                    The Partridge Family?\\r\\n                    I figured it had to be something \\r\\n                    ridiculous to win your respect.

Finally, it \\r\\n          opens.\\r\\n          Hanging inside is a beautiful DRESS, inspired by the 16th \\r\\n          Century.  Mandella slowly unpins a NOTE from the dress.\\r\\n          Mandella\\'s agog.  Trevor walks by and sees her holding the \\r\\n          dress.\\r\\n                    You\\'re gonna look splendiferous in \\r\\n                    that, Mandella.\\r\\n          Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie.\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    that\\'s cool to say.\\r\\n          Mandella grins It is\\r\\n          Sharon is at her computer, Walter at his exercise bike\\r\\n                    Would you rather be ravished by a \\r\\n                    pirate or a British rear admiral?\\r\\n                    Pirate -- no question.\\r\\n          Bianca enters and walks over to Walter\\r\\n                    Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with \\r\\n                    you.

Kissing isn\\'t what keeps me up \\r\\n                    to my elbows in placenta all day.\\r\\n          Bianca lies on her bed.  MTV blares.  A KNOCK sounds.\\r\\n          Come in.\\r\\n          Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the TV.\\r\\n                           (kindly)\\r\\n                    Listen, I know you hate having to sit \\r\\n                    home because I\\'m not Susie High School.\\r\\n                    Like you care.\\r\\n                    I do care.

So I \\r\\n                    did it.\\r\\n                    You did what?\\r\\n                           (continuing on)\\r\\n                    Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I \\r\\n                    didn\\'t want to anymore.  I wasn\\'t ready.  \\r\\n                    He got pissed.

If you really thought \\r\\n                    I could make my own decisions, you \\r\\n                    would\\'ve let me go out with him instead \\r\\n                    of helping Daddy hold me hostage.\\r\\n          Kat stands up slowly\\r\\n                    That\\'s not\\r\\n                    I\\'m not stupid enough to repeat your \\r\\n                    mistakes.\\r\\n                    I guess I thought I was protecting you.\\r\\n                    God, you\\'re just like him!

She rolls over and \\r\\n          picks up the phone.\\r\\n          Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while \\r\\n          watching \"I Love Lucy\" reruns.\\r\\n          A KNOCK sounds\\r\\n                    Come in.\\r\\n          Kat opens the door and peers in with a grin\\r\\n                    Feel like shopping?\\r\\n          Bianca looks up, hopefully.\\r\\n          Walter and Sharon are in front of the television.  Walter \\r\\n          has the TV Guide in hand, glasses on.\\r\\n                    What do you wanna watch?  We\\'ve got \\r\\n                    crap, crap, crap or crap\\r\\n                    Dr. Ruth?\\r\\n          Bianca walks into the living room.  She\\'s wearing a prom \\r\\n          dress.\\r\\n                    Hi, Mommy.\\r\\n                           (looking away)\\r\\n          Walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from Bianca \\r\\n          to Sharon.\\r\\n                    Honey, you look beautiful!\\r\\n                    You like?  My date should be here in \\r\\n                    five.\\r\\n                    I\\'m missing something.\\r\\n                    I have a date, Daddy.  And he \\' s not a \\r\\n                    captain of oppression like some men we \\r\\n                    know.\\r\\n          The DOORBELL RINGS.  Bianca runs to open it.  There stands \\r\\n          CAMERON.  He takes in Bianca\\'s outfit.\\r\\n                    Wow\\r\\n                    Let\\'s go.\\r\\n          Walter rises.  Sharon pulls him back down on the couch\\r\\n                           (to Bianca)\\r\\n                    Have a great time, honey!\\r\\n                    But -- who -- what --?\\r\\n          The door SLAMS.  As Sharon looks at Walter with a grin, a \\r\\n          blur rushes down the stairs and out the door.  The blur has \\r\\n          Kat \\' s voice.\\r\\n                    Hey, guys. I\\'m going to the prom. See \\r\\n                    you in a few.\\r\\n          The door SLAMS again.  Walter and Sharon \\'are alone\\r\\n                    What just happened?\\r\\n                    Your daughters went to the prom.\\r\\n                    Did I have anything to say about it?\\r\\n                    Absolutely not.\\r\\n                    That \\' s what I thought\\r\\n          The DOORBELL RINGS again. Walter opens it to find Joey on \\r\\n          the porch, wearing a tux.\\r\\n                    I\\'m here to pick up Bianca.\\r\\n                    late\\r\\n          He SLAMS the door shut\\r\\n          Kat pulls up in her car, emerging resplendent in an ice \\r\\n          gown.\\r\\n          Patrick sits on the steps, waiting.  In a tux.\\r\\n                    How\\'d you get a tux at the last minute?\\r\\n                    It\\'s Scurvy\\'s.  His date got convicted.  \\r\\n                    Where\\'d you get the dress?\\r\\n                    It\\'s just something I had.  You know\\r\\n                           (smiling)\\r\\n                    Oh huh\\r\\n                    Look, I\\'m  -- sorry -- that I \\r\\n                    questioned your motives.  I was wrong.\\r\\n          Patrick winces slightly, but covers it with a smile\\r\\n                    No prob.\\r\\n          He remains seated.  Kat fidgets nervously.\\r\\n                    are you ready?\\r\\n          He rises and stares at her, taking in her image \\r\\n          appreciatively.  She blushes and turns away.\\r\\n                           (continuing)\\r\\n                    C\\'mon.  Let\\'s get this over with.\\r\\n          A hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world.  Patrick \\r\\n          and Kat enter, Kat attempting to deny the romance of it.\\r\\n                    Quite the ostentatious display\\r\\n          A cowboy two-steps by them, dragging some poor girl around\\r\\n                    Look, Clem even wore his good boots\\r\\n          Kat steps forward, looking around and spots Cameron and \\r\\n          Bianca dancing cheek to cheek.  She smiles.\\r\\n          Mandella enters nervously, in the long Elizabethan gown, \\r\\n          hair piled on top of her head.  She spots Kat and hurries \\r\\n          over.\\r\\n                    Have you seen him?\\r\\n                    Who?\\r\\n                    William - he asked me to meet him here.\\r\\n                    Oh, honey -- tell me we haven\\'t\\' \\r\\n                    progressed to full-on hallucinations.\\r\\n          Patrick looks toward the door and taps Kat.  She turns and \\r\\n          points Mandella the same way.\\r\\n          Michael - in full Shakespearean dress with a new goatee on \\r\\n          his chin - bows in their direction. Mandella\\'s grin couldn\\'t \\r\\n          be bigger.\\r\\n          Michael swashbuckles over to them, taking Mandella\\'s hand \\r\\n          and leading her onto the dance floor.\\r\\n                    Mi\\' lady.\\r\\n                           (to Patrick)\\r\\n                    Good sir.\\r\\n          Patrick rolls his eyes.\\r\\n          Kat and Patrick dance to a slow SONG.  Whatever he\\'s \\r\\n          whispering into her ear is making her laugh.\\r\\n          Cam and Bianca dance nearby, glowing with happiness. She \\r\\n          whispers something in his ear and heads for the ladies\\' room\\r\\n          Bianca walks in, positively radiant. Chastity emerges from a \\r\\n          stall.\\r\\n                           (surprised)\\r\\n                    What are you doing here?\\r\\n          Chastity checks her hair in the mirror,  aloof.\\r\\n                    You think you \\' re the only sophomore \\r\\n                    at the prom?\\r\\n                    I did.\\r\\n          Chastity maintains her snooty tone.\\r\\n                    And just so you know, my date isn\\'t \\r\\n                    planning on spending most of the night \\r\\n                    in his backseat.\\r\\n          BIANCA What\\'re you talking about?\\r\\n                    Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - - \\r\\n                    your cherry. He practically made a \\r\\n                    public announcement.\\r\\n          Appalled, Bianca storms out.

I spent \\r\\n                    a year sitting next to my grandma on the \\r\\n                    couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of \\r\\n                    story.\\r\\n          He takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes.

After a second, \\r\\n          she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight.\\r\\n          Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching.  She\\'s \\r\\n          never looked more guilty.\\r\\n          Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a \\r\\n          blanket, watching \"Sixteen Candles\".  When Molly Ringwald \\r\\n          leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream \\r\\n          date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an \\r\\n          infomercial\\r\\n          The phone sits next to her.  Not ringing.  Bianca breezes \\r\\n          in, bearing a cup of tea.\\r\\n                    Are you sure you don\\'t want to come \\r\\n                    with us?

He peeks his \\r\\n          head inside.\\r\\n                    She okay?\\r\\n                    I hope so.\\r\\n          The door shuts behind her as Walter enters.\\r\\n                    Was that your sister?\\r\\n                    Yeah.
