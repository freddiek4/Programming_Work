Wrapper Function

You are ordering a pizza.
	•	You don’t care how the pizza is made (the dough, the sauce, the toppings).
	•	You just tell the pizza shop your order, and they do the hard work of making it.

The pizza shop is like the wrapper function:
	• takes the request 
	•	passes it to chef who actually makes the pizza (the hard work)
	•	then the pizza shop hands the finished pizza back to you.
